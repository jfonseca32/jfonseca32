I'm an engineer, coder, and robotics enthusiast blending hands-on experimentation with computational intelligence. I build, test, and optimize from 3D-printed squid-inspired nozzles, to high-performance racing cars, to ML-powered control systems. My work is rooted in curiosity and rigor: I design experiments, craft code, analyze data, and turn ideas into tangible results. Let's connect!

My journey started as a Mechanical Engineering student with a fascination for making things move and think, from robots to simulations to all kinds of intelligent systems. Early on, I realized programming wasn’t just a tool, it was a creative superpower. I wanted to be like **Mark Rober**: bringing cool ideas to life by designing, building, and coding both software and hardware. So I dove deep into Python and C++, first automating my coursework, then building my own tools and experimental setups just for the fun (and the challenge) of it.

As I explored further, I got hooked on machine learning, control, and simulation, using code to bridge the gap between theory and hands-on engineering. I taught myself MATLAB, PyBullet, and even dabbled in embedded systems to prototype robots, analyze data, and experiment with new algorithms. There’s something incredibly satisfying about watching a robot do exactly what you told it, especially when you wrote all the code yourself.

Internships in both research labs and industry opened my eyes to the world of robotics, scalable manufacturing, and experimental science. I’ve always thrived in environments where I can own the whole process, end-to-end: design, modeling, fabrication, coding, testing, and iteration. Whether I’m running real-time control on a prototype, optimizing a process for production, or debugging a gnarly bug at 2am, I genuinely enjoy solving hard problems and learning new things.

These days, I’m focused on developing as a coder and engineer, blending AI, software, hardware, and design into whatever project I can dream up, always pushing a little further past my comfort zone.
